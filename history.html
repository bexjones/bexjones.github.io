									<p>I have a pretty varied history. Beginning with a degree in Anthropology and Archeaology from Durham University, I have also worked in hospitality, the wine industry, the film industry, and teaching English as a Foreign language. In 2015 I returned to Anthropology to pursue a MSc in Digital Anthropology from UCL. I am currently studying for a PhD at the University of California, Davis.</p>
									<p>I have lived in New Zealand and Spain and travelled to thirty-fice countries. I have written and directed three short films, as well as producing and working in the camera department on many others. </p>
									<p>I am a musician who has scored two short films and composed numerous songs.</p>
                  <p>This website is intended to display samples of my work and to provide any passing surfer with my details, in case they think my skills might be put to good use. </p>
