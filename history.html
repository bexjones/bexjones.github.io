									<p>I have a pretty varied history. Beginning with a degree in Anthropology and Archeaology from Durham University, I have also worked in hospitality, the wine industry, the film industry, and teaching English as a Foreign language. In 2015 I returned to Anthropology to pursue a MSc in Digital Anthropology from UCL. I am currently studying for a PhD at the University of California, Davis.</p>
									<p>I have lived in New Zealand and Spain and travelled to thirty-five countries. I have written and directed three short films, as well as producing and working in the camera department on many others. </p>
									<p>I am a musician who has scored two short films and composed numerous songs.</p>
                  <p>This website is intended to display samples of my work and to provide any visitor with my details, in case you think my skills might be put to good use. </p>
