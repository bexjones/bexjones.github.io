									<p>Wine became important to me when I finally started tasting wines that weren't essentially drain cleaner. After university I travelled to New Zealand and settled for a year in Wellington. As a place where quality food and drink are essential aspects of the local identity I quickly began to care what I was consuming, and to take notice of taste in a big way. </p>
									<p>A few years after I returned to England I got a job working for Majestic Wines, who send all their new recruits on an Advanced Certificate course with the Wine and Spirits Education Trust. Essentially, I spent six months tasting different wines everyday and training my senses to pick out the subtleties of aroma and taste. Over the years, my tastes have changed, and so have my attittudes towards cheap wine. </p>
									<p>Not all cheap wine is bad, and not all expensive wine is worth it. You don't need to care about wine to enjoy it, but believe me, if you care the rewards are extraordinary.</p>

									<p>'Henry' was the first film I made at film school. My editing tutor had set me the task of writing a short with no dialogue. Other briefs had included making the film about a relationship gone wrong, setting it in one location and for budget reasons, with as few props and expensive equipment as possible. </p>
									<p>One day I was cleaning the studio after an exercise, using a Henry vacuum cleaner; one of the ones with a pair of eyes and a smile on them. It was gazing up at me; playful but at the same time, creepy. I was tempted to tell it to stop looking at me like that. Then the idea struck me. We treat machines as if they had minds of their own all the time. Was it so extraordinary to imagine that someone could extend that interaction to a relationship? </p>
									<p>'Henry' is the story of a man who needs a friend and finds one in the form of a vacuum cleaner. It doesn't go the way some might assume, but it doesn't end well regardless.</p>
