									<p>Arising from a graduate class in Feminist Theory this article explores the processes and affordances of working through the model of the Feminist Science Shop in serving local organizations and interests. A mixture of graduate students and faculty put out a call for local organization who could utilise their expertise to help serve the community. A group called the People Community Medics, who train Oakland residents to treat and survive gunshot wounds while they wait for EMTs are allowed to enter the scene, reached out. This article describes and analyses the collaboration between graduates and community members, imagining a future of academic research and community service. </p>
