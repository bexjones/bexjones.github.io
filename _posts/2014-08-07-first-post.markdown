I started making films while I was an undergraduate. They were mostly terrible, but a lot of fun. I went to film school in London in 2009 and trained to be a cinematogapher and camera assistant. 

I shot a few short films and was even lucky enough to work on a Bond movie and later run the cinema at Pinewood Studios. 

Since returning to academia film has remained one of my most compelling interests and I have turned my skills towards making academic research accessible to a broader audience through film.
