										<h3>The Anthropology of Star Trek</h3>
									</header>
                  <p>The Anthropology of Star Trek introduces undergraduate students to the foundational concepts of anthropological thoery and methodology through broad corpus of Star Trek.</p>
                  <p>Working through a selection of episodes this course contexualises and critiques the ideology and culutral power of Star Trek. It draws attention to themes of colonialism, racism, techno-utopianism, and collectivism vs. individualism.</p>

                                          <h3>Writing Science</h3>
                                     </header>
                  <p>Writing Science explores the role of texts and writing practices in the production of scientific knowledge. Using interdisciplinary methods from both science studies and literary studies, we will learn how language functions in the profession of science and why writing matters for scientific authors. The course focuses on the literary structures of scientific arguments. We trace the development of “literary technologies” across diverse fields of scientific research and communication, from the Scientific Revolution to the present day.</p>
                    <p>Topics include: scientific authorship; the forms and styles of scientific writing; pop-science versus elite science; graphics and paper tools in the experimental laboratory; mass media and cultural narratives of science. </p>
                    <p>These topics are explored through several themes: the 'nature of the universe', the 'nature of life', and 'air pollution as a scientific concept'. </p>
