                            <p>I started making films while I was an undergraduate. They were mostly terrible, but a lot of fun. I went to film school in London in 2009 and trained to be a cinematogapher and camera assistant.</p>

                            <p>I shot a few short films and was even lucky enough to work on a Bond movie and later run the cinema at Pinewood Studios. </p>
                                
                            <p>Since returning to academia film has remained one of my most compelling interests and I have turned my skills towards making academic research accessible to a broader audience through film. </p>

                            <p>I studied wine while working for Majestic Wine and acheived a Level 3 qualification from WSET, the Wine and Spirits Education Trust. Wine remains of interest to me and at one point was a possible topic of study for my anthropological research.</p>

                                     </header>

                                    <p>The Craft Center at UC Davis has provided me with amzing opportunities to learn new skills in art and making.</p>
                                    <p>I have been able to make ceramics, fused glass, wood-working and welding projects.</p>
                                    <p>Perhaps my crowning acheivement was the creation of a chess set and board as a wedding present for a dear friend of mine. The board was a single piece of fused glass, made from over a hundred smaller pieces. And the pieces was made of solid clay glazed in Zack's Black over Buttermilk and Oribe over Leach White.</p>

										<h3>Tracing breath: How wearable air pollution monitors focus concern on breath in London</h3>
									</header>
                            <p>Wearable air pollution monitors focus attention on the air that individuals actually breathe, rather than air pollution as a property of the general environment, regardless of whether it is being breathed. Such devices also emphasise how exposure to air pollution is dependent on the behaviour of the breather, be it how they commute, where and when they work and exercise, or how they ventilate their homes. I argue that conceptualising exposure as a concern for the individual has the potential to lead to a neoliberal approach to air pollution, where protecting oneself supersedes improving the shared environment.</p>

                                    </header>
                            <p>Maps of air quality rely upon technologies and concepts of space embedded in a history of governing and controlling territory. This talk explores the technoscientific context of both locating air in space and making it visible through visualisations.</p>

                                        <h3>Imaging Planet Air: How Images make Air an Object</h3>
                                    </header>
                            <p>From satellite images of the Earth to photographs of smog blanketing cities, Planet Air emerges as an imaginary of our shared air environment that is both protection and threat, life-giving and life-smothering.</p>
