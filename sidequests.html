                            <p>I started making films while I was an undergraduate. They were mostly terrible, but a lot of fun. I went to film school in London in 2009 and trained to be a cinematogapher and camera assistant.</p>

                            <p>I shot a few short films and was even lucky enough to work on a Bond movie and later run the cinema at Pinewood Studios. </p>
                                
                            <p>Since returning to academia film has remained one of my most compelling interests and I have turned my skills towards making academic research accessible to a broader audience through film. </p>

                                         <h2>Wine</h2>
                                    </header>
                                    <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/grapes.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                            
                            <p>I studied wine while working for Majestic Wine and acheived a Level 3 qualification from WSET, the Wine and Spirits Education Trust. Wine remains of interest to me and at one point was a possible topic of study for my anthropological research.</p>

                                         <h2>Arts and Crafts</h2>
                                     </header>

                                    <p>The Craft Center at UC Davis has provided me with amzing opportunities to learn new skills in art and making.</p>
                                    <p>I have been able to make ceramics, fused glass, wood-working and welding projects.</p>
                                    <p>Perhaps my crowning acheivement was the creation of a chess set and board as a wedding present for a dear friend of mine. The board was a single piece of fused glass, made from over a hundred smaller pieces. And the pieces was made of solid clay glazed in Zack's Black over Buttermilk and Oribe over Leach White.</p>
